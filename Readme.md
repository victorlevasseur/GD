GDevelop is a full featured, open source game development software, allowing to create HTML5 and native games
without needing any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is made thanks to an
intuitive and powerful event based system.

How to build [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/4ian/GD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/4ian/GD) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/4ian/GD?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/4ian/gd)
------------

Full and detailed instructions are in the getting started page of the [documentation available here](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation).

Basically:

* Install and launch [CMake].
* Choose this directory as the source directory, and a new directory like Binaries/.build
as the directory where to build. Files will be output in Binaries/Output anyway.
* On Linux, be sure to have [required development libraries](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDCore%20Documentation/setup_dev_env.html) installed. On Windows, be sure to use the same version of [the compiler](http://4ian.github.io/GD-Documentation/GDCore%20Documentation/setup_dev_env.html) for better compatibility.
* Generate the Makefile (or [Ninja] build file) and launch it.
